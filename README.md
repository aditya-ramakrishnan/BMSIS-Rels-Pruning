This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook file with code to generate Energy Change Values for rels file. 
Specifically, the input rels files must be in the format of those in the "rel_files" directory.
Ensure that the input rels file is in the .tsv format, with column titles "ID", "COMPOUND", "TYPE", and "RULE". The titles must be separated with a single tab.
Following the code cells in the Notebook File will show how to calculate and visualize the table of reactions with their energy changes.
